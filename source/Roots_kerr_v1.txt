Unknown Speaker  0:01  
Okay, as I said, I'm going to have two presentations today,

Unknown Speaker  0:06  
both fairly short. The first one a little longer than the second one.

Unknown Speaker  0:12  
And

Unknown Speaker  0:15  
my intent here today is to explore where the roots of Bowen theory reside.

Unknown Speaker  0:24  
The last time I did the webcast

Unknown Speaker  0:27  
people really liked or a restatement of the theory with a certain clarity that the cast conveyed that I hadn't fully appreciated before, how useful it could be to people, but we all spend our lives trying to learn this theory.

Unknown Speaker  0:46  
But the

Unknown Speaker  0:49  
but I'm falling into it back on an interest of mine, which is,

Unknown Speaker  0:54  
what are the roots of Bowen theory? Where do they reside?

Unknown Speaker  1:01  
So the first presentation describes the

Unknown Speaker  1:05  
incredible length of time it can take for a paradigm shift.

Unknown Speaker  1:11  
This in this instance, we'll explore the 2000 or so years it took humankind to shift from the geocentric model

Unknown Speaker  1:24  
to the heliocentric model.

Unknown Speaker  1:28  
This is a set of slides I don't think I've presented very many places before, so I welcome the opportunity to do it today and the next. So the second presentation is unabashedly technical.

Unknown Speaker  1:44  
I couldn't seem to avoid it, and

Unknown Speaker  1:48  
this effort is to describe what goes on in the brain that is related to some aspects of differentiation of self.

Unknown Speaker  2:01  
We have a delivery at the front door, and that's my dog's pulling nuts out until he leaves.

Unknown Speaker  2:10  
Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  2:12  
most are familiar with E equals, MC squared. Everybody probably pretty well knows Einstein

Unknown Speaker  2:20  
is the author of that,

Unknown Speaker  2:24  
and maybe a little less familiar, but I hope not too unfamiliar.

Unknown Speaker  2:30  
It's one I came up with some

Unknown Speaker  2:33  
years ago, D O, S equals e o plus a next

Unknown Speaker  2:41  
slide,

Unknown Speaker  2:42  
meaning differentiation of self equals emotional objectivity plus action. I

Unknown Speaker  2:51  
think that's really a quote from Bowen that I incorporated. The key thing about emotional objectivity

Unknown Speaker  2:59  
that I want to emphasize is that it allows for

Unknown Speaker  3:06  
emotional neutrality.

Unknown Speaker  3:10  
And that emotional neutrality,

Unknown Speaker  3:14  
I think that allows a person to

Unknown Speaker  3:19  
engage somebody in a non, relatively non reactive way,

Unknown Speaker  3:25  
and and taking action on something you know that doesn't

Unknown Speaker  3:32  
violate the boundaries of the other or allow the other to violate your own boundaries.

Unknown Speaker  3:39  
Emotional neutrality, I think, is a real important concept, along with emotional objectivity and Bowen ideas.

Unknown Speaker  3:51  
Over the course of my 50 plus years of trying to master Bowen theory and its applications,

Unknown Speaker  4:00  
hallmark of my effort has been broadening my perspective,

Unknown Speaker  4:05  
trying to broaden my perspective on Bowen theory. I

Unknown Speaker  4:09  
think a broad perspective apparently powerfully contributes to gaining that emotional objectivity that permits neutrality and action based on that.

Unknown Speaker  4:24  
So it began with a nuclear family,

Unknown Speaker  4:27  
then the multi generational family. This was my personal

Unknown Speaker  4:32  
path. Then evolution

Unknown Speaker  4:35  
of late, delving into the cosmos,

Unknown Speaker  4:40  
may prove a treacherous route to take. Today, I'll give you a taste of my efforts without claiming any profound breakthroughs. I

Unknown Speaker  4:54  
guess my basic direction

Unknown Speaker  4:58  
is learning about the case.

Unknown Speaker  5:00  
Carry overs from the physical to the biological realms.

Unknown Speaker  5:07  
In other words,

Unknown Speaker  5:09  
was we know if the physical world preceded the biological world. And I think it's, you know, pretty reasonable to

Unknown Speaker  5:20  
to recognize that

Unknown Speaker  5:24  
that physical, early physical evolution on the earth

Unknown Speaker  5:31  
has hung on in in helping us understand the biological, physical functioning of human beings,

Unknown Speaker  5:41  
as I proceed, if you hear any background noises, they may be sounds of Murray Bowen turning over in his grave.

Unknown Speaker  5:50  
Please don't let such noises divert your attention too much.

Unknown Speaker  5:57  
What are the roots of Bowen theory.

Unknown Speaker  6:03  
And I'm going to

Unknown Speaker  6:06  
talk about solar system models,

Unknown Speaker  6:10  
Aristotle Einstein.

Unknown Speaker  6:15  
This part of my effort to illustrate how science, in this case, a physical science progresses and stagnates over a long period of time.

Unknown Speaker  6:29  
What will the course of Bowen family sister systems theory be like?

Unknown Speaker  6:34  
I suspect it will not take 2000 years to dominate the public consciousness as did heliocentrism,

Unknown Speaker  6:45  
as well, as we'll see in what follows.

Unknown Speaker  6:49  
I thank Kathy Kerr

Unknown Speaker  6:52  
for these two Christmas presents,

Unknown Speaker  6:55  
which I devoured pretty quickly

Unknown Speaker  6:59  
after Christmas. The first a more perfect heaven, by Dave Sobel, and the other there, Galileo and the Science Deniers, by Mario Livio.

Unknown Speaker  7:13  
I think that did push me along to wonder, want to

Unknown Speaker  7:18  
view and better understand the physical universe

Unknown Speaker  7:23  
that preceded the biological universe,

Unknown Speaker  7:28  
and try to see how they're both interrelated and what's been preserved, as I've been saying.

Unknown Speaker  7:37  
So I go back to Aristotle, and I actually didn't know this until

Unknown Speaker  7:44  
set out to pull this together.

Unknown Speaker  7:49  
But you see his

Unknown Speaker  7:51  
lifetime, 384, BC to 322

Unknown Speaker  7:55  
and he was definitely wedded the geocentric

Unknown Speaker  8:00  
universe. And this is a model that he had made with the earth. There at the center,

Unknown Speaker  8:10  
you see on the outside of the earth, this cloud of air which permits life,

Unknown Speaker  8:17  
and then farther

Unknown Speaker  8:20  
out and out the moon for curing Venus, Mars Jupiter, Saturn, with the sun orbiting around the Earth. And most of you probably know that's why they call it geocentric, because it emphasizes the earth as sort of the center of everything in the solar system

Unknown Speaker  8:44  
and and God really has made it that way

Unknown Speaker  8:48  
to remind us of our importance

Unknown Speaker  8:52  
to the whole situation.

Unknown Speaker  8:56  
But I, I'd forgotten that heard this, I think, in on Cosmos series 30 years ago, but Aristarchus,

Unknown Speaker  9:07  
unbelievably, just born a few years after Aristotle died,

Unknown Speaker  9:13  
he he authored a heliocentric model, And this, that's this model that went underground for 2000 years. As you can see, he puts the

Unknown Speaker  9:27  
sun at the center, heliocentric,

Unknown Speaker  9:31  
then various planets, Earth and the Moon, the third out there, and on out to those known planets, all the way to Saturn in his day.

Unknown Speaker  9:43  
So Aristarchus was a astronomer and mathematician.

Unknown Speaker  9:48  
He was first known

Unknown Speaker  9:51  
for the heliocentric model

Unknown Speaker  9:54  
placed six known planets in the correct order around.

Unknown Speaker  10:00  
It, that's all that could be observed for the naked eye at that point.

Unknown Speaker  10:09  
So, and this is, this is what

Unknown Speaker  10:13  
is a paradigm shift, huge paradigm shift that waited 2000 years to be reawakened,

Unknown Speaker  10:21  
that, to me, was the power of this story.

Unknown Speaker  10:25  
How long it can take for a paradigm

Unknown Speaker  10:29  
to shift Next one, please.

Unknown Speaker  10:33  
So Ptolemy. Many of you heard of Ptolemy.

Unknown Speaker  10:39  
He was one of the great, supporters of the geocentric universe,

Unknown Speaker  10:46  
and he was

Unknown Speaker  10:48  
several 100 years younger than

Unknown Speaker  10:52  
Aristarchus and Aristotle.

Unknown Speaker  10:55  
There you see that he had the Earth at the center of it all he envisioned to explain what they were looking at in the cosmos, that all the planets

Unknown Speaker  11:10  
were on rotating spheres,

Unknown Speaker  11:14  
Earth, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, stars again, the sun orbiting around the Earth.

Unknown Speaker  11:24  
And then, in order to explain

Unknown Speaker  11:27  
certain movements that couldn't otherwise be explained, he invented

Unknown Speaker  11:34  
this thing called epicycles,

Unknown Speaker  11:37  
which periodically these planets would

Unknown Speaker  11:42  
go around in a circle on themselves, in their orbits, and that could explain

Unknown Speaker  11:51  
why the planets looked where they were when they studied them.

Unknown Speaker  11:58  
Next one. Please do

Unknown Speaker  12:07  
but with that, all changed, with Nicholas Copernicus,

Unknown Speaker  12:13  
who probably almost everyone is familiar with, he restored credibility in the heliocentric universe, and definitely credited Aristarchus for being the true author of that,

Unknown Speaker  12:30  
as you can see, then he's got the sun at the center, Mercury, Venus, the earth with our moon circling the sun, vice versa, and on out to Mars and Jupiter Saturn, the known planets at that point in time in our history,

Unknown Speaker  12:49  
that was a big, big

Unknown Speaker  12:51  
change. He was himself, kind of wanted to play it down,

Unknown Speaker  12:57  
because there was so much opposition to this idea.

Unknown Speaker  13:02  
Again, religion was very much tied up in this as well,

Unknown Speaker  13:08  
because the the church, and particularly the Catholic Church and the Jesuits,

Unknown Speaker  13:15  
insisted

Unknown Speaker  13:17  
that God put us, would have put us at the center of the universe. It can't be,

Unknown Speaker  13:25  
can't be heliocentric. So there's a lot of resistance. See, he wanted, he thought he'd get a lot of trouble if he pushed his ideas too hard.

Unknown Speaker  13:36  
Please.

Unknown Speaker  13:38  
Along comes Johannes Kepler,

Unknown Speaker  13:44  
and

Unknown Speaker  13:46  
he was the first borrowing tons of

Unknown Speaker  13:50  
sightings without telescope. Tycho Brahe.

Unknown Speaker  13:56  
Tycho Brahe,

Unknown Speaker  14:00  
this moving object at the bottom is showing out

Unknown Speaker  14:05  
the

Unknown Speaker  14:06  
that's really a

Unknown Speaker  14:09  
ellipse, and how a model he

Unknown Speaker  14:16  
used to explain this

Unknown Speaker  14:19  
and that the sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time,

Unknown Speaker  14:27  
was one of his principles that he put forth.

Unknown Speaker  14:32  
Figured out that the square of a planet's orbital period proportional to the cube of the length of the major semi, major axis of its orbit. I won't try to explain that, but he, he, he came out with

Unknown Speaker  14:50  
not a theory, but laws that these orbits seem to obey without any understanding.

Unknown Speaker  15:00  
Ending of,

Unknown Speaker  15:02  
how did, how did you come to be that way? And you can't expect much on that. For the instruments they were, they were dealing with,

Unknown Speaker  15:11  
Brahe was very important in collecting visually all this material. Next one, please.

Unknown Speaker  15:21  
So the man who did it, I'm sure most all of you know, is the one with

Unknown Speaker  15:28  
the telescope in his hand there, Galileo Galilei

Unknown Speaker  15:34  
and

Unknown Speaker  15:36  
and he was what he called an observational astronomers,

Unknown Speaker  15:42  
astronomer.

Unknown Speaker  15:45  
So with his telescope, he was able to

Unknown Speaker  15:49  
describe the faces of Venus,

Unknown Speaker  15:53  
describe the four largest satellites of Jupiter,

Unknown Speaker  16:00  
Saturn's rings and sunspots

Unknown Speaker  16:04  
and

Unknown Speaker  16:06  
again, that set up a Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, which appeared to attack Pope Urban

Unknown Speaker  16:18  
the eighth and thus alienated both the Pope and the Jesuits, who had early on supported Galileo, until he they fully realized what he was talking about, which was pliocentric.

Unknown Speaker  16:35  
And so he was tried by the Inquisition. Inquisition found vehemently suspect of heresy, heliocentrism, and forced to recant. He did not. He spent the rest of his life under household rest, which was 10 years.

Unknown Speaker  16:56  
Next we move

Unknown Speaker  16:59  
to someone well known to all of you, Isaac Newton.

Unknown Speaker  17:07  
And he's the person who introduced the notion of forces, the force of gravity. That was a way to explain by understanding the force of gravity,

Unknown Speaker  17:20  
he could explain how Kepler arrived at the laws of planetary motion.

Unknown Speaker  17:27  
Hey, that was a very interesting step,

Unknown Speaker  17:30  
because forces, as you know, are very big in Bowen theory. They're not widely used in biology by a long shot.

Unknown Speaker  17:42  
So he could account for plant the laws the that

Unknown Speaker  17:46  
Kepler described for the movement tides back and forth during the seasons and during a given time period, trajectories of the comets and

Unknown Speaker  17:59  
procession of the equinoxes and other phenomenon eradicating doubt about the solar system being heliocentric,

Unknown Speaker  18:12  
solar system being other than heliocentric. So that's a huge He really put the nail in the coffin on that one. He was mathematician for excellence, as I say there. And his his basic theory that's for

Unknown Speaker  18:29  
everybody credits him with is the idea of universal gravitation, that this operated everywhere in the universe.

Unknown Speaker  18:39  
Next one, please.

Unknown Speaker  18:41  
And then guess who pops onto the scene with VM equals MC squared?

Unknown Speaker  18:48  
Einstein had his theory of special relativity that I certainly won't try to explain. Don't understand it well enough to do that. That expresses the fact that mass and energy are the same physical entity, I found that just an extraordinary insight, that mass and energy are the same physical entity, they can be changed into each other

Unknown Speaker  19:18  
and out of How he arrived at that insight, I don't know, but in the equation, increased relative relativistic mass, the M of a body times the speed of light squared C squared

Unknown Speaker  19:34  
is equal to the kinetic energy of that Body. I can't remember where on the websites I found this, but it just reminded me of what an incredible contribution this was to understanding

Unknown Speaker  19:52  
the world around us,

Unknown Speaker  19:55  
please.

Unknown Speaker  19:58  
So I.

Unknown Speaker  20:00  
Then I began delving deeply into the physical world. I thought, more and more I've got to better understand.

Unknown Speaker  20:10  
Wanted to understand if and whether I could

Unknown Speaker  20:17  
what the forces existed in that physical world that have been carried over into the biological world that had been carried over by a pioneer called Murray Bowen, into the understanding of human behavior.

Unknown Speaker  20:33  
Again, forces is not something that's commonly talked about

Unknown Speaker  20:38  
in that arena. So I went to Frank Wilczek. I forget how I ran into his book, but

Unknown Speaker  20:46  
it's 10 keys to reality, but a very well known, recognized physicist. So this next small bit of material is going to be from his book. Next one.

Unknown Speaker  21:02  
So maybe all of you know, some of you know, probably very few in the audience could list the six particles, five particles you list there, the physical world is constructed using very few kinds of ingredients.

Unknown Speaker  21:19  
Moreover, those ingredients are ideally simple in the sense that they only have a handful of properties. And what's that group? Of course, the electron, the photon, the U quark, the D quark and the gluon. I won't get bogged down in trying to explain those because I don't. They'd have to be a much better scholar to do that, but the ordinary matter of our bodies, that's what we're built from.

Unknown Speaker  21:48  
And recognizing that again, I think, begs to say, Well, what

Unknown Speaker  21:55  
given the electrons, photons, you quark and the qthe quarks and the Unknown Speakernt.

Unknown Speaker  22:04  
How is this expressed

Unknown Speaker  22:07  
in the body of a mammal such as Homo sapiens?

Unknown Speaker  22:12  
What kind of

Unknown Speaker  22:14  
constraints or possibilities exist with that?

Unknown Speaker  22:19  
So there's very few physical laws,

Unknown Speaker  22:23  
and that there's the same everywhere and always.

Unknown Speaker  22:29  
Physicists, I know they have their disagreements, I believe, but there's they have the privilege of having a whole bunch of stuff that everybody agrees about. Yes, this is the way it works. Next one,

Unknown Speaker  22:44  
so the physical laws simply describe what will happen.

Unknown Speaker  22:50  
They don't describe

Unknown Speaker  22:52  
should happen or anything like that. They simply describe and predict what will happen.

Unknown Speaker  23:02  
Six, expressed in mathematical equations, which I don't think Bowen theory will ever be

Unknown Speaker  23:09  
possible. Well, many are interested in that area, and maybe pull it off. Could pull it off, I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  23:17  
expressed as mathematical equations among precisely defined quantities. I mean, the physical world is very, very well understood, I think, and organized.

Unknown Speaker  23:29  
Next one, please.

Unknown Speaker  23:33  
So they leave no room for ambiguity, for disagreement among competent they put competent experts. They all agree on these things.

Unknown Speaker  23:44  
Next one, please.

Unknown Speaker  23:47  
So biology now comes along,

Unknown Speaker  23:51  
suggests another direction,

Unknown Speaker  23:54  
the future of matter. Next slide, and

Unknown Speaker  23:59  
if

Unknown Speaker  24:01  
he's talking about thinking of cells as elementary particles, advanced life forms

Unknown Speaker  24:09  
that they're the elementary particles, kind of, I guess, synonymous with the quarks and The

Unknown Speaker  24:17  
and we were discussing earlier.

Unknown Speaker  24:21  
These are the elementary particles of advanced life forms such as ourselves. They share a bag, a large bag of tricks that enable them to function as repositories of information and chemical factories. A lot of new capacity there with biology. Next one

Unknown Speaker  24:43  
also sophisticated interfaces with the external world, which enable them to gather resources and exchange information.

Unknown Speaker  24:53  
Biology, then there was a huge leap in what was possible. So.

Unknown Speaker  25:00  
So

Unknown Speaker  25:03  
the most unique feature of biological cells to which present day engineering has no close analog,

Unknown Speaker  25:13  
is the power of modulated self reproduction.

Unknown Speaker  25:20  
First unicellular life, later, multicellular life.

Unknown Speaker  25:26  
And again, please, keep on trying to think what carries over from one phase of all this to the next.

Unknown Speaker  25:32  
Does this have anything to do with what Bowen came up with

Unknown Speaker  25:37  
in terms of counterbalancing lifeforces?

Unknown Speaker  25:42  
So in appropriate, reasonably forgiving environment, cells will gather ingredients to make new cells

Unknown Speaker  25:49  
that are close but not necessary to them, but not necessarily exact copies of themselves, allowing for variation,

Unknown Speaker  25:59  
which was later have been backed up by genetics, as you know, and these differences are not random

Unknown Speaker  26:07  
follow programs contained within the cell itself.

Unknown Speaker  26:14  
Excellent.

Unknown Speaker  26:17  
So

Unknown Speaker  26:19  
in this field of physics,

Unknown Speaker  26:23  
and

Unknown Speaker  26:25  
this writer writes about this, the concept of complementarity.

Unknown Speaker  26:32  
Concept is that one single thing considered from different perspectives can seem to have very different or even contradictory

Unknown Speaker  26:43  
properties, and we're he's talking about the physical world here

Unknown Speaker  26:49  
next one. Niels Bohr,

Unknown Speaker  26:55  
we said harmony is a local analysis, while melody is a more global analysis.

Unknown Speaker  27:04  
I mean, I would say, I mean, I would say melody would be synonymous with Bowen theory, but it's also consistent with local analysis. You can't do those two forms of processing at the same time. I won't try to delve into that one. That's Niels Bohr picture.

Unknown Speaker  27:26  
So to measure something's properties, you must interact with it,

Unknown Speaker  27:33  
and that's going to change what you're seeing. Science tells us many things

Unknown Speaker  27:40  
about how things are, does not pronounce how things should be, and

Unknown Speaker  27:46  
this reminds me of Murray Bowen. Often quoted individuality or togetherness. You have a choice, that choice is yours,

Unknown Speaker  27:57  
and the next one,

Unknown Speaker  28:00  
free will and physical determinism are complementary aspects of reality.

Unknown Speaker  28:11  
Next one, please.

Unknown Speaker  28:15  
So now I'm going to shift over in the latter part of this section of the two talks to lessons from cancer research. And some of you've seen me present this before, but I'm going to just summarize it to try to give a better sense of carryover from what I've been describing earlier to what's going on now in cancer research. Next one.

Unknown Speaker  28:41  
So some will remember, I ran across this book, kind of by accident. I forget how I got to it,

Unknown Speaker  28:50  
but it's a book called The Society of cells,

Unknown Speaker  28:55  
cancer in the control of cell proliferation,

Unknown Speaker  28:59  
and that's

Unknown Speaker  29:01  
edited by two folks down at Tufts,

Unknown Speaker  29:06  
Carlos Sonnenschein and Anne Marie Soto. They're part of the Department of anatomy and Cellular Biology

Unknown Speaker  29:14  
at Tufts,

Unknown Speaker  29:17  
and I, I had vowed to go down there and meet them, and they invited me down to talk about some of this stuff in Bowen theory, in exchanges by email, Sonnenschein took the time to respond and explain why he didn't think Unknown Speaker 29:36 a lot of the things I was saying were relevantvant to what his work was.

Unknown Speaker  29:41  
But said, please come down and we can discuss all this further. And I haven't yet made that trip

Unknown Speaker  29:49  
that led to the next slide,

Unknown Speaker  29:53  
person who's going to be our featured speaker for the Bowen theory Academy.

Unknown Speaker  30:00  
Conference in early October,

Unknown Speaker  30:03  
she's going to be presenting virtually from Rome, Italy,

Unknown Speaker  30:10  
and she's an assistant professor of the philosophy of science at that college in Rome.

Unknown Speaker  30:18  
And you can see she's a pretty young woman, but has done some incredible stuff, and I stumbled across her book, and I thought, well, philosophy of cancer. Now, what the heck is this all about?

Unknown Speaker  30:32  
Then you can see as a subtitle, a dynamic and relational view, and this is what's had the huge impact on my

Unknown Speaker  30:44  
enthusiasm about

Unknown Speaker  30:46  
acceptance of Bowen theory sooner or later,

Unknown Speaker  30:50  
rather than later. I've often said that if a systems theory of an individual can be

Unknown Speaker  30:58  
developed, and I think her work moves it in that direction significantly

Unknown Speaker  31:04  
uses systems thinking to do it that

Unknown Speaker  31:09  
that's going to make it easier to

Unknown Speaker  31:12  
connect it to The Bowen

Unknown Speaker  31:17  
family systems theory. Next one, please.

Unknown Speaker  31:22  
So she is very interested in cancer and

Unknown Speaker  31:26  
not in plenty of other things. But

Unknown Speaker  31:30  
she said the origin of cancer seems to be entangled with the very nature of living things.

Unknown Speaker  31:38  
I forget if I have this what I'm going to say now later in this set of statements on these slides, that's the thing Murray Bowen said to me. I can distinctly remember us riding from Georgetown hospital

Unknown Speaker  31:54  
back to the family center

Unknown Speaker  31:57  
in the mid 1970s and

Unknown Speaker  32:01  
we heard on the radio that, or guess, I guess we're just talking about it. Nixon had declared the war on cancer,

Unknown Speaker  32:10  
and Murray said, Mike, that's not going to solve it. It's not going to solve it. Cancer is a part of nature. It's not a disease.

Unknown Speaker  32:20  
I think she is presenting a lot of solid evidence to back that up. Next one.

Unknown Speaker  32:27  
So the other thing that she and I have exchanged about, and we've met on virtual along with Lana Hardy about several months ago to discuss what could happen in this conference we're going to do. I going to

Unknown Speaker  32:43  
do. But what intrigued me was she, she,

Unknown Speaker  32:48  
these count back counter balancing forces for one, for differentiation. And that's not Bowen differentiation, it's cell differentiation into particular abilities to perform certain kind of functions in a multi cellular organism, versus what she called State holding processes. And I think that's a very sharp parallel

Unknown Speaker  33:14  
with individuality and togetherness,

Unknown Speaker  33:18  
that the togetherness process is trying to keep the system

Unknown Speaker  33:24  
stable and intact, and that's what she's referring to there, said so on an email exchange,

Unknown Speaker  33:32  
and the

Unknown Speaker  33:34  
differentiation is not the same.

Unknown Speaker  33:37  
We all know that, but the counterbalancing forces, she agrees, yes, there seems to be a lot of parallel. There. Next one.

Unknown Speaker  33:47  
Next slide, please.

Unknown Speaker  33:49  
So proliferation versus differentiation, and these are the steps that she got to

Unknown Speaker  33:56  
think in my words, that led her to the need for systems, for dynamic, relational thinking, and using systems thinking to do that,

Unknown Speaker  34:07  
that

Unknown Speaker  34:09  
proliferation versus differentiation,

Unknown Speaker  34:13  
and her key point is cancer As a disease of cell differentiation rather than multiplication.

Unknown Speaker  34:24  
In other words, it's a case of blocked ontogeny. What appeals to me in that is that's exactly what it is in Bowen theory

Unknown Speaker  34:36  
that differentiation,

Unknown Speaker  34:39  
as you know, as a result of consequence of the

Unknown Speaker  34:44  
level of fusion between parent and offspring,

Unknown Speaker  34:51  
that ontogeny or full development of the organism is hampered

Unknown Speaker  34:58  
so that.

Unknown Speaker  35:00  
Um,

Unknown Speaker  35:06  
anyway, case of blocked ontogeny. Let me stop there with that next slide,

Unknown Speaker  35:11  
so as metazoan cells in culture

Unknown Speaker  35:15  
come free from the bonds of homeostatic influence necessary coordinate the needs of a multicellular organism,

Unknown Speaker  35:24  
liberated metazilla and cells may require they acquire latent ancestral properties, including

Unknown Speaker  35:34  
proliferation and mobility. Now what I'm trying to get at there, I put regression. It seems like this is an indication of regression,

Unknown Speaker  35:45  
that when a single celled organism

Unknown Speaker  35:51  
with all its way of doing things,

Unknown Speaker  35:55  
that the point that it becomes part of a multicellular organism

Unknown Speaker  36:01  
is the point at which

Unknown Speaker  36:04  
you need specialists make it work, and you need stability to make it work.

Unknown Speaker  36:12  
And

Unknown Speaker  36:15  
when multi cell or single celled organisms were formed,

Unknown Speaker  36:22  
if when they reform like if they they don't mature properly.

Unknown Speaker  36:27  
The idea is that what comes next is a regression earlier ancestral properties of cells,

Unknown Speaker  36:36  
they had the ability to reproduce themselves.

Unknown Speaker  36:44  
And their own way of about understanding when it's time to do that, which I don't know how they do it, but

Unknown Speaker  36:53  
that once those cells are beginning to move back out of the multicellular mold

Unknown Speaker  37:02  
into the liberated

Unknown Speaker  37:04  
mode right there in the body.

Unknown Speaker  37:08  
Then it allows proliferation of the cells in a way that's abnormal, which is cancer, proliferation and mobility.

Unknown Speaker  37:20  
I think that supports the idea of thinking of it as a regression, that something is disturbing the homeostasis within the particular tissue involved, which I think is also a reflection of the disturbance of homeostasis for the organism as a whole. And I would take it out to the family level as well, of course,

Unknown Speaker  37:44  
but that the their

Unknown Speaker  37:48  
properties become more and more ancestral, and they and

Unknown Speaker  37:55  
they're reawakened because they're now acting like they're not part of A group, yet they are part of a group, and that's that's what we're calling a disease, that they're just

Unknown Speaker  38:09  
replicating in a way that doesn't it destroys the tissue around them

Unknown Speaker  38:17  
and where they're doing it.

Unknown Speaker  38:19  
Next one.

Unknown Speaker  38:21  
So a biological entity

Unknown Speaker  38:24  
acts as a dynamic multi unity

Unknown Speaker  38:30  
system, not as parts full of organization.

Unknown Speaker  38:35  
I think that's the same idea of emotional field

Unknown Speaker  38:40  
when you, when you look at this biological entity,

Unknown Speaker  38:45  
look at an emotional field. Bowen theory terms,

Unknown Speaker  38:51  
not parts and holes,

Unknown Speaker  38:53  
because it's, it's all linked together in a way that where's the part where the whole, where's the whole? It's, they're all linked together in a way that's indistinguishable.

Unknown Speaker  39:07  
So the maintenance and persistence of its construction requires two different modes of causation, again, differentiation causal dynamics and stakeholder causality to provide unity.

Unknown Speaker  39:23  
The differentiation causal principle is related to how the whole is organized through functionally heterogeneous elements.

Unknown Speaker  39:35  
The State, holding quality, holding causality, is tied to the unitary dynamic stability of the whole at different levels of organization. And I said to her in an email, family is yet a different level of biological organization that individuals within it are being

Unknown Speaker  39:58  
affected significantly.

Unknown Speaker  40:00  
Okay, and if you don't understand

Unknown Speaker  40:03  
the family system, it's impossible to have a complete picture of what's going on. Say, with a schizophrenic person, there's more to it than it is within the person. It's a symptom of a larger process in the family system.

Unknown Speaker  40:22  
So now to crawl way out on a limb,

Unknown Speaker  40:26  
and here's the evolutionary tree, and there's man up there in the right

Unknown Speaker  40:33  
and the idea that all living things belong to one family and are descended from common ancestors,

Unknown Speaker  40:41  
which is evolution, of course. Next one,

Unknown Speaker  40:47  
excellent.

Unknown Speaker  40:48  
Let's tap it again. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  40:51  
Here is my conjecture. Has the individuality, life force evolved over the long course of evolution from processes involved in self regulation

Unknown Speaker  41:05  
and the togetherness life force from processes involved in regulating and being regulated by others,

Unknown Speaker  41:14  
these life forces reflect Anything about physical laws, two different levels of investigation, but complementary. So that's where I've come out on it.

Unknown Speaker  41:27  
This is indeed possible that these life forces that Bowen is talking about have roots deep in our

Unknown Speaker  41:36  
history of biological history, but also in the physical history of the universe. Maybe

Unknown Speaker  41:43  
the next thoughts, I think, is the last well, does my presentation here today bring us any closer to Bowen Theory's roots? A firm No,

Unknown Speaker  41:53  
secondly, but I do think the

Unknown Speaker  41:56  
kind of knowledge I have presented about non living and living systems is what ultimately will provide. The answers certainly aren't there yet. And next one,

Unknown Speaker  42:07  
I think we can safely say the answers extend beyond the boundaries of our species, which I think Bowen believed as well. So I admit it ain't over till the fat lady sings, and she ain't sung yet.

Unknown Speaker  42:22  
Okay, so I'll stop here for

Unknown Speaker  42:27  
if people have some questions or comments they'd like to make about this, I'd like to hear what you got out of it, and hopefully something that's useful to you, and it wasn't too didn't seem too far afield from

Unknown Speaker  42:42  
everyday work as a clinician, let's say,

Unknown Speaker  42:46  
if anybody has a

Unknown Speaker  42:48  
comment or question, or if you just put yourself in the chat room,

Unknown Speaker  42:53  
I'll call on You as you come in.

Unknown Speaker  42:59  
Amy post, okay? Amy,

Unknown Speaker  43:03  
Dr, Kerr, I was thinking about the function of chronic anxiety and this idea that if the

Unknown Speaker  43:14  
cell is having difficulty managing its function and its stability in relationship to other, it reverts back to a latent way of behaving before. And we have this idea in Bowen theory that differentiation is related to the amount of chronic anxiety that lives in the family unit. Would you see the latent call back to a fire prior function being similar to that chronic anxiety function. That's the way my brain works.

Unknown Speaker  43:46  
Yeah, I think

Unknown Speaker  43:50  
I don't know what a cell biologist would do with chronic anxiety in a cell.

Unknown Speaker  43:57  
Knew something equivalents got to be there, part of a regressive process, as you're talking about,

Unknown Speaker  44:04  
I think that pulls forward a really important distinction. Sometimes I've heard chronic anxiety is described as causal. There's too much of it, and that makes this family more impinged. But when you put it back into a recollection of a former way of being that was initially adaptive. It changes it from being a problem to solve to a retained capacity that was necessary for survival.

Unknown Speaker  44:33  
I think it's well said. Thank you. Amy,

Unknown Speaker  44:36  
Okay, who's next here? Dave Galloway, Hello, David, hi. Thank you for this. My

Unknown Speaker  44:44  
comment was on the idea that

Unknown Speaker  44:47  
the observations you know throughout the history of astronomy illustrate that people can have lots of valid, correct data points you.

Unknown Speaker  45:00  
But depending on the theory they use to conceptualize them, you know, they'll be useful or not in a way, in predicting and planning and that kind of thing. And so I think that to the degree that Bowen theory is accurate, there could be lots of observations from other areas of science that should mesh with it.

Unknown Speaker  45:22  
And it doesn't have to come directly from Bowen theory. You know, just like all the observations fit into Copernicus and Kepler's models and that kind of thing, once they had a good theory to talk about them with. Gotcha.

Unknown Speaker  45:36  
Yep, good point. Thank you. David, yeah. Arthur

Unknown Speaker  45:39  
rose, you.

Unknown Speaker  45:47  
Those thinking about the parallel with evolution that when Darwin and Wallace came up with their concept about evolution, they didn't have the benefit of using genetics

Unknown Speaker  46:00  
and heredity to think about theory. Those came later and were incorporated in. And the theory had to be adjusted here and there, but

Unknown Speaker  46:11  
all the ideas ended up being validated by later science.

Unknown Speaker  46:16  
I'm also reminded that when, when they went into outer space and tested parts of Einstein's theory and said, Oh, it really works. His response was, of course it works.

Unknown Speaker  46:29  
Yeah, no, I see what you get that. I think it's good point, and I think that's for the future.

Unknown Speaker  46:36  
Janice Norton, okay, Janice,

Unknown Speaker  46:40  
just

Unknown Speaker  46:43  
the comment about

Unknown Speaker  46:45  
this seems so relevant to my clinical work and my family,

Unknown Speaker  46:50  
the development is hampered by a lack of differentiation. And that's my new that'll be my new index card on my bulletin board in my office. I mean, what else is there? You know, it just puts it right out there, and

Unknown Speaker  47:07  
kind of highlights the unnecessary amount of detail and categories and diagnoses that inform so much of that clinical world. But really, development is hampered by a lack of differentiation, we'll stop, okay, yeah. I mean, I think it's a much more neutral view that stops blaming the mother. It's not her fault that this symbiosis occurred. Is multi generational, and he was just trying to be the best mother she can be. And I think that's what helps a lot of Bowen theorists deal with these families is that they're not judgmental of the family and how it's going

Unknown Speaker  47:47  
okay. So who next me? Kathy Kerr I think I remember her. She's the bookkeeper. A couple of comments about the interesting possibility you raise of physical

Unknown Speaker  48:02  
concepts from physics and laws moving over into in any way, could they help us to understand human beings and biology in general? And

Unknown Speaker  48:19  
I was struck by one of your slides where you had that in in physics, there are precisely defined entities that always behave X way. I don't think that's the definition of living entities. I think in living entities. What we get into is probabilities. It is most probable that

Unknown Speaker  48:48  
x Dave, when a package is delivered to Mike and Kathy Kerr's house she is going to bark her head off.

Unknown Speaker  48:56  
Very low probability that she will not do that.

Unknown Speaker  49:00  
But it's not impossible, but at some point she might not do that.

Unknown Speaker  49:05  
We're talking about you. Maisie, so, so the other thought was that comes out of my sort of deep dive into different types of systems theories and

Unknown Speaker  49:19  
people who have been using second order cybernetics have been working for years to create life.

Unknown Speaker  49:28  
They can't do it.

Unknown Speaker  49:31  
They can create

Unknown Speaker  49:35  
a membrane,

Unknown Speaker  49:38  
but they can't populate the membrane with all the ingredients of the cell which would create a living cell. So it argues, as Monty Python used to argue, that when, however life did happen, that something maybe not completely.

Unknown Speaker  50:00  
Different, but importantly, different happens when you move into moving systems. And so I was just thinking about that. And then I was thinking about Unknown Speaker 50:12 Bertalanffy. Unknown Speaker 50:15 Bertalanffy'sBertolos, dynamic, multi, unity is such a different concept than either general systems or cybernetic systems. Understanding of what is, what are you looking at when you're trying to understand, analyze the system, and

Unknown Speaker  50:38  
you had, I forget what you put up there as the

Unknown Speaker  50:42  
driving thing. But, you know, I was thinking, Oh, you put up emotional field. I was going to put up emotional system.

Unknown Speaker  50:50  
You're looking at an emotional system and that

Unknown Speaker  50:56  
of necessity, you're not going to ever create foolproof diagram of an emotional system, like you can of a thermostat.

Unknown Speaker  51:09  
Wait, those are some random thoughts. Okay, is Randy last?

Unknown Speaker  51:15  
He's next, and then there's Margaret Otto. Okay, we'll get those. Randy used to bat. Lead off. Now you're batting down with the pitcher.

Unknown Speaker  51:26  
Well, that may be appropriate.

Unknown Speaker  51:31  
No, I was just thinking about the,

Unknown Speaker  51:35  
you know, Einstein's discovery that mass and energy were the same thing, you know,

Unknown Speaker  51:43  
in different forms. And

Unknown Speaker  51:48  
in a way, Bowen concept of differentiation, no

Unknown Speaker  51:54  
as it emerges from

Unknown Speaker  51:57  
the relationship of families to individuals who become adults form families of their own,

Unknown Speaker  52:04  
that

Unknown Speaker  52:08  
it's undifferentiated from that original family

Unknown Speaker  52:15  
translates into the vulnerability to

Unknown Speaker  52:21  
the four mechanisms of dysfunction or maladaption, some adaptive capacities, but

Unknown Speaker  52:32  
things like conflict and Distance and and

Unknown Speaker  52:37  
functioning of kids and functioning of spouses, that this phenomenon of

Unknown Speaker  52:48  
separation, degree of separation and differentiation from the original family,

Unknown Speaker  52:56  
then that amount of undifferentiation plays out in these four other areas under varying conditions. It's it just reminded me of taking two things that seemed unrelated

Unknown Speaker  53:12  
and relating them, which is Einstein did with mass and energy.

Unknown Speaker  53:18  
High praise.

Unknown Speaker  53:21  
Thank you. And the last one, we'll go to Kansas City. Here I come

Unknown Speaker  53:27  
hardly. I could hardly make it up the hill this morning in the snow, but

Unknown Speaker  53:33  
I was thinking about the disparity between reality and the view of it, and all the history you went into and how it just seems to gradually get closer

Unknown Speaker  53:45  
to the way it is. And that's how I think I've been thinking about differentiation of self lately, the emotional cue and the family and the disparity between the reality and of course, the broader that is, the lower the functioning. And two other points are just sort of a little random, but one is, you know, to me, long time to realize that chronic anxiety didn't necessarily feel bad. Manic people feel great. Psychotic people when they're, you know, thinking they're Jesus, they feel great. It doesn't have to be a negative emotion, and it's hard to convey that with the word anxiety or chronic, but it doesn't necessarily have to have a negative affect. And then just a final point, I think it was Dave that commented on it that in some ways, new tests aren't really needed, new measurements aren't really needed. It's just a new view using the same instrument.

Unknown Speaker  54:46  
So that's it. Appreciate it. You're welcome. Okay, well, this next presentation I have is shorter. I think I can do it in

Unknown Speaker  54:59  
22

Unknown Speaker  55:00  
Uh, minutes or so we'll still have about 10 minutes for questions. If Cathy could pull that up, please.

Unknown Speaker  55:12  
This one is more recent

Unknown Speaker  55:15  
in my efforts.

Unknown Speaker  55:18  
I just, I think again, stumbled across this book, I think it was in the New York Times Book Review,

Unknown Speaker  55:26  
and

Unknown Speaker  55:28  
emotional. And I thought, well, I can always learn something from that, a feeling shape our thinking. Leonard, Unknown Speaker 55:37 Mlodinow, I guess he pronounces it PhD PhD. And so I'm going to take and pass along a certain number of points he made in his book that I thought were would be of great interest to Bowen theory people.

Unknown Speaker  55:57  
So here's a concept, as I said in the parentheses, a new idea to me called core affect. I'd never heard of that before.

Unknown Speaker  56:08  
It is believed to represent the input of your body, which, when combined with the circumstances you find yourself in, the context of the situation and your background knowledge will produce emotions you experience.

Unknown Speaker  56:25  
That would be true for dogs, people and beyond. I mean, I think that's a I just never heard of it. The idea of core affect

Unknown Speaker  56:36  
maybe others have, but he amplifies it by saying it's a neurological state in higher animals, more than just humans, that acts as a Sentinel to watch for threats to homeostasis and influences an organism to respond to accordingly. This threats to homeostasis, I think, is a profound importance in the body responding to that and trying to limit any damage and restore equilibrium.

Unknown Speaker  57:10  
See in the family was

Unknown Speaker  57:13  
togetherness is usually used to try to restore equilibrium. So one, just to review, one definition homeostasis. Homeostasis refers to that ability of an organism or individual cell to maintain its stable internal order, even in the face of changes in the environment could threaten it

Unknown Speaker  57:38  
next one.

Unknown Speaker  57:40  
So we humans evolved to exercise not purely rational thought, but but rational thought, guided and inspired by emotion

Unknown Speaker  57:51  
that reminded me of Murray Bowen's

Unknown Speaker  57:56  
comment

Unknown Speaker  57:58  
about that,

Unknown Speaker  58:01  
that the intellectual system

Unknown Speaker  58:04  
and the feeling system emotional system

Unknown Speaker  58:08  
are a working team.

Unknown Speaker  58:12  
So

Unknown Speaker  58:17  
next one,

Unknown Speaker  58:19  
emotions arose as a more flexible way of reacting to novel circumstances. Just found that interesting. I just never thought of it that way. Emotions arose as a more flexible way of reacting to novel circumstances. Next one,

Unknown Speaker  58:39  
organisms like the planaria, which 560 million years ago. That's not, not that long ago.

Unknown Speaker  58:47  
You measure it in Earth time,

Unknown Speaker  58:50  
among the first to have nervous systems.

Unknown Speaker  58:54  
And they find, as a result, they finally graduated from a reliance on program automatic responses. In other words, some input would come in from the environment,

Unknown Speaker  59:06  
and

Unknown Speaker  59:07  
one or another, automatic responses would kick in automatically to preserve the life of that individual

Unknown Speaker  59:16  
and these creatures,

Unknown Speaker  59:18  
planaria, 560 million years ago, with a nervous system, they had a new ability. They could assess novel situations and react with actions that were tailored to specific circumstances and goals. And that is quite a boost. Just recently, five, 60 million years next, one. So two major topics in this book. One is motivation, and we'll start with that.

Unknown Speaker  59:49  
This is a fellow Kent Berridge. He's based at University of Michigan.

Unknown Speaker  59:54  
He's one who has described distinction between enjoyment and.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:00  
Motivation.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:02  
Thank you. We all talk about,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:05  
you know, the the

Unknown Speaker  1:00:10  
emotional system,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:13  
but how does it really play out in the brain? That's what I was trying to think through as I read this book.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:22  
So he concluded that our reward system

Unknown Speaker  1:00:26  
there is a distinction between liking something and the motivation to seek it, which we call wanting. So activation of the reward pathway by addictive drugs

Unknown Speaker  1:00:41  
would then motivate one, for example, to seek those drugs

Unknown Speaker  1:00:48  
if they wanted them.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:50  
The emotional system, again, is the force that motivates the relationship system is the way it is expressed.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:01  
So

Unknown Speaker  1:01:04  
like, liking that is pleasure, and wanting, desiring that is motivation. They're two separate things are produced by two distinct interconnected subsystems within our reward system. I just never knew that before. I found it very interesting. Liking as pleasure, wanting and desired. Desiring are two different things, and you can prove this with drugs, where you can make animals desire something that's awful,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:39  
or an animals that want something, that have no motivation to get it, even though it seems obvious how it could happen, so they're produced by two distinct interconnected subsystems within our reward system, in the brain, we have a separate wanting circuitry to determine whether we are motivated enough pursue any particular instance of pleasure.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:07  
Next one

Unknown Speaker  1:02:09  
by blocking dopamine chemically, he was knocking out the rats wanting system, but not the circuits used for liking.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:20  
So the rats would

Unknown Speaker  1:02:23  
be exposed to something they've liked,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:28  
but didn't necessarily try to get it,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:32  
employing a tiny electrical current into their brains to stimulate wanting circuits, he induced them to guzzle down a bitter quinine solution, something that tasted awful, but he could get him because of the wanting circuit.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:49  
And it's so compelling to try to think of this at the brain level, I find

Unknown Speaker  1:02:55  
the judging by rats facial expressions when they drank it, the rats found it unpalatable. He's supposed to be an expert in reading the emotional state of rats by looking at their faces.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:08  
The liking subsystem employs opioids, endo cannabinoids. So we all know about these things natural, the natural versions of heroin and marijuana and its neurotransmitters are opioids and cannabinoids.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:28  
He went on to look for such dissociations between and liking in human behavior.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:36  
One example occurs in people who are addicted to drugs such as nicotine, and desperately want their fix when it produces little or no feeling of pleasure.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:48  
Focus of advertising is to stimulate not your enjoyment of an item, but your desire to have it. Those bastards,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:57  
I never knew that before. His brother is a

Unknown Speaker  1:04:02  
in advertisements, psychologists have found that when we run into barriers in a quest to attain something, we sometimes want it more. We sometimes want it more, while think liking it less

Unknown Speaker  1:04:17  
and it's hard to get,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:20  
hard to get. Condition that playing hard to get is they gave an example of two women who dated.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:29  
They met these. The men met these two women.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:33  
One was very, very attractive, and the other one was attractive, but very hard to get.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:42  
And were they attracted to the very attractive one? No, they went to the Hard to get condition, liking it less.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:53  
Good old Socrates advised a courtesan, prostitute, in essence, Theodote.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:00  
That she would attract more friends if she would sometimes withhold her affections until men are hungry with desire, good old Socrates.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:10  
So he's pinpointing the specific areas in the human brain where the neurons responsible for pleasure and motivation are located. So

Unknown Speaker  1:05:21  
and

Unknown Speaker  1:05:23  
whenever we feel compelled to eat, drink, copulate, sing, watch television, exercise, signals from the neurons

Unknown Speaker  1:05:34  
are likely

Unknown Speaker  1:05:37  
a real inspiration. That's what inspires us, the signals from the neurons is only after the desire arises that it

Unknown Speaker  1:05:48  
passes into our orbital frontal cortex, which creates conscious experience of it. That's where Bowen theory comes in.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:58  
In

Unknown Speaker  1:06:00  
human beings, wanting is stimulated by liking, but not automatically before activating our wanting circuits. Our brain takes liking into account as well as other factors, meaning conscious self control.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:20  
So the other thing they look into is determination. This is a different set of research. William Seeley, neurologist at UC San Francisco,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:33  
are the discoverers of the emotional salience network and the executive control network.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:44  
Emotional salience network nodes are anchored in the so called limbic structures.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:52  
Executive control network, in contrast, includes sites in the executive prefrontal cortex, a region known to have a role in sustained attention and working memory.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:06  
He doesn't mention Paul McLean anywhere in the book, the originator of the triune brain gets bypassed and these he first credits

Unknown Speaker  1:07:16  
somebody much more recent,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:19  
so the picture of the limbic system, and then, of course, the prefrontal cortex. And then, so we're talking here on theory. Certainly the capacity for self regulation has everything to do with the frontal cortex. But feelings can't be ignored. I mean, they they are a guide to what needs to be done, and the two work together.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:41  
Salience network monitors our internal emotions and our external environment and take note of what is important.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:51  
Identifies the most relevant among those inputs and spurs you to act or not act on that basis, the

Unknown Speaker  1:08:01  
executive control network has the job of keeping you focused on what is relevant to your goals while ignoring distractions.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:14  
The ECM, the executive control network jumps into action once the salient next salience network has been activated, it then marshals the brains resources to enable you to act if necessary. Next, one

Unknown Speaker  1:08:32  
team of neurologists at Stanford, as part of a clinical assessment of patients, were implanting electrodes in a patient's brain,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:44  
serendipitously in one of the implantation cycles in which they were asking person to about his sensations when they were in a specific spot in the brain.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:01  
Thoughts? What are your thoughts? Feelings? The man reported feeling determination,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:09  
if it was, if it was not dread, but a positive feeling that says, push harder, push harder to try to get through this. It's a beautiful piece at the beginning of the chapter, there this part of the book about a prize fighter who, I think it was Sonny Liston. He knocked out when he was Sonny Liston was champion of the world, and the next time he faced Liston in a rematch. Liston knocked him out in the first round, the first time, the guy was determined he's going to do this. And I forget all all that went into that, but that I thought that was a fascinating thing, that the feeling of determination

Unknown Speaker  1:09:55  
make or break

Unknown Speaker  1:09:58  
the visit home to see your family with.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:00  
Knowledge of Bowen theory in your head, it takes some determination to change. The doctors had gotten lucky. They had inadvertently implanted the electrode in a single, tiny node of the complex salience network.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:16  
When they moved the electrode a few millimeters, one way or the other, the effect did not occur. But when it's placed just right, patient reported an urgent sense of the need to act or to persevere.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:32  
Doctors looked for the node in a second patient and found it in the same anatomical position. I don't know about you guys, but to pinpoint

Unknown Speaker  1:10:42  
these kind of emotional feeling states in us and exactly in the brain where this is all coming from. For any of these things, it's It's extraordinary.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:53  
Salience network is reflected by its multiple nodes and their wealth of connections to other parts of the brain, it engages in dialog with both the executive control network and other executive areas of the frontal lobe, as well as sub cortical parts of the brain that are involved in producing physiological reactions, ultimately feeling reactions as a result it is formed by both what we think and what we feel? Bowen, 101, right.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:26  
The researchers had activated a kind of grit switch in the emotional salience executive control complex. I had no idea these kind of

Unknown Speaker  1:11:39  
studies were going on and how much they were learning that is fascinating to make more sense out of human behavior. So some final thoughts

Unknown Speaker  1:11:51  
scientists have learned about determination and its opposite, apathy gives us insight into a most

Unknown Speaker  1:11:59  
basic functions of our emotions

Unknown Speaker  1:12:03  
more fundamental in its effects than love or hate, happiness or sadness or even fear and anxiety. Determination is what gives us the urge to act, to reach out towards something or someone, to speak or even just to move, and the energy to see our actions through until we achieve the goal. I should have thought about this, I guess I have, I don't know, but determination being so crude, critical to success

Unknown Speaker  1:12:36  
in what you're trying to achieve.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:39  
So the stoics might have initiate intuited but could not have explained

Unknown Speaker  1:12:46  
stoics. The executive network structures in our prefrontal cortex exert influence over the many subcortical structures associated with motion. I mean, not this much was known about the brain when Bowen developed this theory. I mean, he

Unknown Speaker  1:13:02  
enough was known to give him the intellectual system, emotional system, idea. But this now has fleshing it out.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:14  
We successfully orchestrate that. What I just read, we achieve emotional regulation.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:21  
Relation.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:23  
Question for Bowen theorists, what is the we'll get back to Amy's comment. What is the impact of chronic anxiety on the processes reviewed in this presentation? Anybody who knows love to hear it. Think that's the end.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:40  
All right, we're in good shape,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:46  
at least for time. I don't know about mental state.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:50  
Somebody there still has their sound off on, if you would be kind enough to turn it off.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:57  
Okay, see if this generates any

Unknown Speaker  1:14:01  
thinking.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:04  
What's my picture of Michael Kerr?

Unknown Speaker  1:14:13  
This to go down first. I

Unknown Speaker  1:14:30  
something, Please, say something. Please.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:35  
I have my hand up. Would you like me to say something? I would love you to say something.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:41  
Go ahead. Amy, Dr Kerr, my brain made a bridge between some of the ideas you presented. I'm not sure if it's accurate, but I think Bowen theory would suggest the degree to which life energy is going into maintaining that state holding process would be would inhibit the degree to which.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:00  
Energy could go into that determinate determination function,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:05  
okay? And that would be perhaps the role of chronic anxiety, that latent request to go back to just maintaining the home and homeostasis is the driver. There's less available to be pursuing what you want or think you like

Unknown Speaker  1:15:22  
interesting idea.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:24  
I'll keep thinking about that one. Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:32  
Where are we? Anybody else? Does anyone else wish to make a comment? Yeah, it's Abig Galloway. Number two, again,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:44  
I

Unknown Speaker  1:15:46  
thought a lot about chronic anxiety because I could never, for myself, figure out what it actually was other than a kind of definition. And what I've been landing on these days is that I believe that in my development, my family of origin, there was a certain level of attention and vigilance set up for what I would pay attention to and watch out for. And in my history, it's been loosely described as pleasing other

Unknown Speaker  1:16:22  
that that level of vigilance and orientation then ends up creating a certain level of anxiousness in me that's just there all the time as I'm constantly and this isn't fully conscious, unless I really pay attention to it, constantly scanning, what does other want, what does other want, what does other want? And that the discomfort from that, you know, then leads to soothing behaviors, like, Can I have the right answer? Can I please this person? Can I over function for them? And that kind of thing. So that's how I think of it. For me, the chronic anxiety is the outcome of the emotional programming that set up a certain level of vigilance. Is how I think of it.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:08  
Makes sense. And then the threat would be, if you didn't do it, something wrong with Yeah, yeah. Because way I think about that is you have

Unknown Speaker  1:17:22  
do disturbance in homeostasis to one degree or another,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:27  
then the body

Unknown Speaker  1:17:29  
then reacts To restore homeostasis

Unknown Speaker  1:17:34  
and

Unknown Speaker  1:17:38  
and activates the stress response

Unknown Speaker  1:17:43  
to

Unknown Speaker  1:17:45  
to help deal with that and that, then the stress response become a chronic state at one level of another, which is then as experienced as chronic anxiety within the

Unknown Speaker  1:17:59  
individual. That's kind of rough, but that's one way I have a talking about the stress response. I think chronic stress response is central to

Unknown Speaker  1:18:09  
understanding what's going on in the body as a whole.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:16  
Just very briefly, I would see it as my constant state of vigilance to see if anything is shifted. You know, that creates a stress response that we're right, noticing, judging, monitoring, yeah, thank you. It's time consuming,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:36  
yeah, but you got to do what you got to do, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:18:40  
Wasn't my fault.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:45  
Mark grooms. Hello. Mark, not trying to throw a firecracker into things, but go for it. Well, I've recently been reading Lisa Feldman Barrett, whom I think you referenced Mike in an earlier presentation, maybe a few years ago. Oh, yeah, and she raises all kinds of problems with Paul McLean's train brain model. I never read that, yeah, and I

Unknown Speaker  1:19:13  
it's got me thinking, okay, what are the implications for different models of brain organization on thinking about chronic anxiety, differentiation of self,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:25  
and

Unknown Speaker  1:19:27  
the concepts that we've been working on with Bowen thinking for all years, and

Unknown Speaker  1:19:33  
is the model of the brain evolving with people like her and Mlodinow And some folks you've been referencing today. Is it getting more complicated or or is it getting clearer? I guess is my question. I don't know. I had the privilege, thanks to Margaret Otto organizing the meeting to do a meeting with myself and her a couple of years ago, and I.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:00  
I came away from the media

Unknown Speaker  1:20:02  
thinking she was mostly addressing feelings and subjectivity

Unknown Speaker  1:20:09  
but had not included these more fundamental origins. And then I went to her book, and I forget what's in her book, but there's a lot of different theories of emotion

Unknown Speaker  1:20:22  
flying around out there as I understand it. And

Unknown Speaker  1:20:26  
I just thought she's an interesting contributor. It was good to have the meeting with her, and

Unknown Speaker  1:20:33  
she, she talks about the old theory of emotions and the new theory of emotions. And I don't, I don't get it. What she's getting at there,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:44  
because,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:47  
like, the person I fall back on heavily is,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:53  
oh, Jaak Panksepp,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:56  
that book of his that I read is, to me, the most useful.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:01  
Okay, well, thanks for your question.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:03  
Hardy, hello, Lana,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:07  
hello. Are you in? Maine, I know I'm in California. You're in California now. Can you flew back?

Unknown Speaker  1:21:16  
May I Okay? I will do that.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:20  
Okay, yes, here's California.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:22  
It's warm here. Incredible. Remember that? Remember that pain?

Unknown Speaker  1:21:27  
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:29  
Well, I am curious, very curious, about this determination aspect of what you're talking about, because it makes me think a lot about the book Cure and cancer, and how people there seem to always have that sense of determination at you know, having read some of the I haven't read all of it, but all the people that I read about seem to have some push to go and get through this. And so I think it's just interesting way of looking at how it looks, maybe because it sounds like that might be a part of what they're that's

Unknown Speaker  1:22:02  
fair. Very interesting point. I

Unknown Speaker  1:22:05  
I remember,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:07  
I think I saw this. I've maybe heard me quote this before. I think it was in Family Circle, one of the important medical journals

Unknown Speaker  1:22:17  
that the individual who was doing some kind of study,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:23  
decided to go to the

Unknown Speaker  1:22:27  
what's the what do they call that?

Unknown Speaker  1:22:31  
It contains all the people who have been diagnosed with cancer, cancer registry, cancer registry at their hospital, let's say,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:42  
and then did a follow up

Unknown Speaker  1:22:46  
on whether these people were still living or not, and tried to figure out, what's the difference between those who seem to have beaten it and those who haven't?

Unknown Speaker  1:22:56  
And

Unknown Speaker  1:22:59  
it was. There's no one answer, I guess. But the critical sin thing seemed to be captured by

Unknown Speaker  1:23:09  
the idea that

Unknown Speaker  1:23:11  
two patients go to see a doctor and the doctor says,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:18  
we have all these drugs will throw at you. And if you just

Unknown Speaker  1:23:23  
do that, we'll get it done.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:26  
And

Unknown Speaker  1:23:28  
the guy says, throw everything you got at me. That's what I want. I'm determined to get the best.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:35  
And then the other patient came in and said, Doctor, if I stay here in this hospital any longer, you guys are going to kill me. I'm determined to get out of here.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:45  
Was the common denominator determination,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:48  
and that, I think that's what helped me so much about red ego book, is that just how incredibly important the mind can be

Unknown Speaker  1:23:59  
in recovery in ways we don't still, I don't think, fully understand.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:05  
Thanks for your comment about

Unknown Speaker  1:24:12  
it. So I had another comment. Okay, Kathy Kerr and then we'll come then. Janice, I think, oh, no, no, she's not in the cube.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:21  
She's right behind me. Okay, so I'm thinking about this

Unknown Speaker  1:24:29  
issue of

Unknown Speaker  1:24:31  
chronic anxiety and adaptability.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:37  
And I thought Dave Galloway's description of how his psych anxiety has been tuned.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:46  
And in a sense, you could call that adaptive to the Galloway family emotional system.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:56  
But it might not be from Bowen theory perspective, it might not be.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:00  
Long Term adaptive for Dave Galloway, which was the question he seemed to be raising. So it made me think about how this doesn't seem to be much question

Unknown Speaker  1:25:11  
the distinction between acute and chronic anxiety, that acute anxiety is adaptive. None of us better get up in the morning and try to move through the day without it. But what is the adaptive value of chronic anxiety, especially if it pushes organisms to regress to previous states that are not adaptive to their current situation? So that's what I was thinking about. The only thing that comes to mind for me. You may have heard me talk about this one before I may have even put it in my book. Last book

Unknown Speaker  1:25:46  
about the bee colony that I think

Unknown Speaker  1:25:51  
that's his name, Raj Khadi Kerr studied where

Unknown Speaker  1:25:57  
they were studying these colonies. And

Unknown Speaker  1:26:03  
and then the one

Unknown Speaker  1:26:05  
day started coming and was discovering that the number of

Unknown Speaker  1:26:14  
bees or wasps, footer was, I guess, wasps on the colony was rapidly declining.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:21  
And, then on a particular day, the number had dropped by about seven or eight, and I think there were, like about 40 on the colony, counting the queen.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:33  
And he said, What the heck is going on here? Why are these individuals leaving?

Unknown Speaker  1:26:39  
And by because he had recorded

Unknown Speaker  1:26:42  
each individual wasp or paper

Unknown Speaker  1:26:47  
wasp with a color code. He key note. He could go back through his notes because he had taken careful

Unknown Speaker  1:26:59  
recording of those notes, and found that in the weeks prior,

Unknown Speaker  1:27:07  
the individuals leaving

Unknown Speaker  1:27:10  
that the

Unknown Speaker  1:27:12  
there were two warring factions. You remember this one on the nest,

Unknown Speaker  1:27:19  
and what you could call, I think, a regressive phenomenon, and then they split. Next day he came, a bunch of them had disappeared, and started a new nest about a mile away. I don't know how he found it, but reproductive rates had

Unknown Speaker  1:27:40  
resumed. They had chosen the Queen, and life was much better. So I just got the idea in my head that regression can motivate, think this was part of your question, or thought, regression can motivate a call for action like that that can

Unknown Speaker  1:28:01  
like when Murray used to talk about a family with schizophrenia,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:06  
we'd go all the way until their backs were to the wall, and they all of resources, financial and emotional,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:18  
or were being exhausted.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:21  
And then finally, somebody said, I can't keep doing this this way anymore. We're just but they had to be forced against the wall to see that. But then came the determination to pull out of it.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:36  
How much that relates to you want to comment anymore? No, I'd like to give Janice Norton a chance to have the last comment. Janice, you got the last comment? This is a very important one. This Don't let us down. I am prepared.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:50  
I was on this business of determination. I think that's so important. And I just finished a short paperback book called I choose life by a

Unknown Speaker  1:29:03  
therapist and a nine year old boy who survived, years ago, an astrocytoma, brain tumor that was determined to kill him, and it's a pretty good description, I think, of his determined voice comes through beautifully,

Unknown Speaker  1:29:21  
and what he did, he used a lot of visualization. He relied on a lot of adults for support, and his friends. He He ditched out a family therapy. Told his parents to keep going. He'd had enough. I thought that was fantastic.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:37  
And there's enough, there's there's some family data in there about how maybe a nine year old got cancer at the point in time he did not a lot, but some it was it. It was just really, and it's an interesting read. I'd love to know how that this is like 30 years ago, how that kid is doing now, but I don't know, but the determination thing really comes through.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:58  
Same with the book. Again. I.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:00  
I choose life. I choose life. And I think, and the child's name is Garrett Porter, I believe. And the psychologist name might be Pat Norris, I don't know she's I could have that one wrong, but I got paperback on Amazon. Yeah, some of these people, I think he can locate online if they've been associated with some

Unknown Speaker  1:30:23  
well known book, like this one, maybe, or something I would try is, because that's very interesting.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:30  
The kid taking the initiative. Lots of initiative. Yeah, I'm getting this from my assistant,

Unknown Speaker  1:30:39  
so I gotta go now. Well, thanks for coming. It's good to see you all, and I hope today was useful and see you next time.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:48  
Thank you. Dr Kerr, you're welcome.
