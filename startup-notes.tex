What happened: Your old .venv was pointing to an iCloud path that no longer exists, so I had to recreate it. This is common when moving projects between locations.

Quick reference (add to your notes):

Activate venv: source .venv/bin/activate
Run GUI: python3 transcript_processor_gui.py
Back up to GitHub: git add . && git commit -m "description" && git push
