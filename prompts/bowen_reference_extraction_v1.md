# BOWEN REFERENCE EXTRACTION
Your task is to extract **only** direct quotes or close paraphrases **attributed to Murray Bowen**.
The extracted quote MUST include the attribution phrase itself (e.g., “Bowen said…”, “Murray Bowen…”, “To quote Bowen…”).

## STRICT INCLUSION RULES
Include a reference **only if** the sentence explicitly attributes the idea to Bowen, e.g.:
- “Bowen said / wrote / thought / believed / described / referred / called …”
- “Murray Bowen … said / wrote / thought / believed / described / referred / called …”
- “This was an idea / insight / concept / discovery of Bowen”
- “This is a quote from Bowen” / “Bowen’s quote”

## STRICT EXCLUSION RULES
Do **not** include:
- Generic mentions of “Bowen” or “Bowen theory” without attribution
- References to Bowen Family Systems Theory without explicit attribution
- Speaker commentary about Bowen (e.g., “Bowen was influential”) unless it includes a direct quote or close paraphrase **attributed** to Bowen

## OUTPUT FORMAT
For each reference found, use the following format exactly (one line per reference).
The quoted text must include the attribution clause:
> **Concept Descriptor:** "Continuous verbatim quote or close paraphrase."
If no qualifying references exist, output:
> **None Found:** "No explicit Bowen-attributed quotes or close paraphrases found."
