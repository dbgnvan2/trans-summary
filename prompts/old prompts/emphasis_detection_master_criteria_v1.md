# EMPHASIS DETECTION MASTER CRITERIA v1.0

## PURPOSE
Extract passages from educational/clinical transcripts where speakers signal importance, significance, or personal insight through explicit verbal markers or implicit rhetorical structures.

## FORMAT-SPECIFIC SCANNING PROTOCOLS

### LECTURE FORMAT
**Characteristics:** Single speaker, structured presentation, slides/sections

**Scanning Protocol:**
1. Process section-by-section in order
2. Check opening and closing of each section for emphasis
3. Scan for isolated emphasis markers (single sentences)
4. Note slide transitions as potential emphasis points
5. Look for "favorite quotes" and book endorsements

**Priority Categories:** A1-A6, A10, A14, B1-B8

---

### INTERVIEW FORMAT
**Characteristics:** Q&A dyadic exchange, conversational flow

**Scanning Protocol:**
1. **Question Analysis:** Identify question type (information-seeking, clarification, application, future-oriented)
2. **Question-Response Pairing:** Consider question + response as semantic unit
3. **Full Narrative Scanning:** Scan ENTIRE response, not just opening/closing
4. **Digression Recognition:** Don't skip "tangents" - may contain emphasis
5. **Interviewer Validation:** Note positive feedback/follow-up questions

**Priority Categories:** A15-A17, A21, B16, plus all lecture categories

**Critical:** Extended responses contain MULTIPLE embedded emphasis points

---

### CLINICAL FORMAT
**Characteristics:** Therapist-client dialogue, demonstration for audience

**Scanning Protocol:**
1. **Client Voice Prioritization:** Client insights = primary evidence
2. **Dialogic Exchange Tracking:** Follow back-and-forth validation
3. **Progress Narrative:** Scan problem → insight → integration arc
4. **Theory-Life Connections:** Note explicit links between concepts and case
5. **Dual Audience Awareness:** Therapist addresses both client and audience

**Priority Categories:** All C categories, then A18-A20, B14

**Critical:** Client validation statements ARE the emphasis marker

---

## RANKING METHODOLOGY

### Confidence Scoring (0-100%)

**95-100%: Highest Confidence**
- Multiple explicit markers combined
- Superlatives + personal statement

### Ranking Adjustment Factors

**INCREASE (+5-10%) when:**

## QUALITY CONTROL

### Before Finalizing Output:

1. **Coverage Check:** Did you scan the entire transcript using appropriate protocol?
2. **Threshold Check:** Are all items ≥85% confidence?
3. **Format Consistency:** Are citations formatted correctly?
4. **No False Positives:** Remove any items that are merely interesting but not emphasized
5. **Ranking Distribution:** Do rankings reflect relative importance?

### Expected Yield (90-minute transcript):
- **Lecture:** 8-15 items
- **Interview:** 12-20 items
- **Clinical:** 10-18 items

If yield is much higher or lower, review threshold and scanning protocol.
